# Decentralized File Storage System

A blockchain-powered ecosystem that provides secure, reliable, and efficient decentralized file storage through a network of incentivized storage nodes.

## Overview

This platform revolutionizes file storage by creating a decentralized network where users can store files securely across multiple nodes, with automatic redundancy, encryption, and transparent incentive mechanisms.

## Core Smart Contracts

### Storage Contract

Manages the complete lifecycle of file storage:
- File upload processing
- Chunk distribution
- Redundancy management
- Storage verification
- File retrieval coordination
- Garbage collection
- Version control

### Node Reputation Contract

Implements comprehensive node reliability tracking:
- Uptime monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Response time tracking
- Storage verification
- Slashing mechanisms
- Reward distribution
- Historical performance analysis

### Payment Contract

Handles automated micropayments for storage services:
- Usage-based billing
- Token staking
- Payment channels
- Automated settlements
- Fee calculations
- Reward distribution
- Payment verification

### File Sharing Contract

Manages sophisticated access control mechanisms:
- Permission management
- Access key distribution
- Sharing link generation
- Group access control
- Time-based permissions
- Access revocation
- Audit logging
